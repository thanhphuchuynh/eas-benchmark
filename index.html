<div id="myDiv" style="overflow: auto; height: 100px;">
    <p>In this example, we first get a reference to the div element using document.getElementById. We then retrieve the scrollTop, scrollHeight, and clientHeight properties of the div. If the sum of the scrollTop and clientHeight is less than the scrollHeight, that means there is hidden content. We then retrieve the hidden text using the substring method on the textContent property, starting at the visibleHeight and going to the end of the text content.</p>
  </div>
